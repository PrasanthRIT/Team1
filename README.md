Project Description: 
TigerBoard is a Commuter Management System designed to optimize RIT's commuting experience
for both students and the drivers in RIT Dubai. The web application streamlines communication
between commuter students and transportation services to a dedicated portal where both the students
and drivers can manage their plans and commuting trips without any ambiguities or miscommunications 
that lead to unexpected delays or latencies for the trips. The system helps students view real-time bus availability, 
book rides based on their commuter plans, and avoid missing buses due to miscommunication. For drivers,
it provides confirmed passenger lists for each trip, eliminating unnecessary waiting
time and improving overall efficiency.
